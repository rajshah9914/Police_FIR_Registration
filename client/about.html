                <p>Online Complaint Monitoring System (OCMS) is a system operated by India. A Complaint Management System is one of latest productivity enhancement tools used widely by all organisations[citation needed] wherever there is a need of booking of complaints via operators and analysis of complaints which are made or are pending.</p>

Software allows a booking operator to book and lodge complaints and automatically schedules and prompts operators to source complaint to concerned departments. State of the art management information reports on complaint details and pending complaints with reasons and remarks provides management a better insight to problems and traffic situations of telephone lines. A never before “Report Wizard” not only allows you to define specific reports on demand but also allows you to define your own sorting and analysis parameters which may be more relevant to you but not programmed by us till now.</p>
                <p>Automated Complaint Processing Software is becoming more and more available, based on natural language processing (NLP) Natural language processing and reasoning about mental attitudes Propositional attitude. The system extracts communicative actions and their subjects and classifies .a complaint as valid or invalid (submitted due to a customer misunderstanding, bad mood or other unrelated issues)</p>
